## Data Cleaning Notes (to apply before import)
•	Salary: Convert from string (e.g., "$58,628.00") to decimal by:
o	Removing $ and commas
o	Converting to DECIMAL
•	Missing Values: The dataset contains nulls in all columns. Handle via:
o	NULL values in SQL
o	Or filter rows using WHERE clauses as needed

##  Sample SQL Queries
1. Average salary by department
sql

SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM salary_structure
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
2. Gender pay gap analysis
sql

SELECT gender, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM salary_structure
GROUP BY gender;
3. Salary distribution by work experience
sql

SELECT work_experience, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM salary_structure
GROUP BY work_experience
ORDER BY work_experience;
4. Detect outliers in salary
sql
SELECT *
FROM salary_structure
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) + 2 * STDDEV(salary) FROM salary_structure);

##  Notes
•	Ensure data types are consistent during import.
•	Normalize department names if needed (e.g., fix typos like ADMINSTRATION → ADMINISTRATION).
•	Consider indexing department, gender, and work_experience for faster queries.

## General Analytical Questions:
1.	What is the average salary across all roles or departments?
2.	How does salary vary by job title, department, or grade level?
3.	What is the distribution of salaries across the dataset (minimum, maximum, median)?
4.	Are there salary disparities based on gender or location (if applicable)?
5.	Which departments have the highest and lowest average salaries?
6.	Is there a correlation between years of experience and salary (if that data is available)?
7.	How does overtime or bonuses contribute to total compensation?
